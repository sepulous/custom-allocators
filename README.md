# Custom Memory Allocators

This repository provides C++ implementations of useful custom memory allocators. They are all self-contained, and I wrote them to be portable from C++11 onward so that they can simply be copied and pasted into any such project. Each file has a comment at the top explaining my design decisions, as well as the distinctions between the different allocators (which are often either neglected or muddled in discussions).
