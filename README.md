# Custom Memory Allocators

This repository provides C++ implementations of useful custom memory allocators. They are all self-contained, and I wrote them to be portable from C++11 onward so that they can simply be copied and pasted into any such project. I did my best to make them as efficient as possible, while also providing a reasonable degree of functionality for users (which can easily be discarded, if they so wish). Each file has a comment at the top explaining my design decisions, as well as distinctions between the different allocators (which are often either neglected or muddled in discussions).
